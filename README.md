#Variables
* You can assign variables by typing ```variable == 1``` or ```variable == "string"``` 
* You can attach variables to anything like integers or strings
* The word variable can be replaced with anything that you would like to help you code

* To use variables you can ```print variable```
* The code should output ```1``` or ```string```

* There are also different types of variables such as 

```
float(x)   # This converts x to a floating-point number
str(x)	   # This converts x to a string representation
repr(x)    # This convers x to an expression string
```

#Conditionals
* ```if-statements``` create a "branch" in the code
* You can do something like a choose your own adventure type of thing
* Or you can just plug in variables and see the results


* For Example 
```
hunter = 100
harrison = 3
ben = 50 

if hunter > harrison
	print "Hunter is cooler than Harrison"
if ben > harrison 
	print "Ben is cooler than Harrison"
if hunter > ben
	print "Hunter is cooler than Ben"
```

##What you should see
```
Hunter is cooler than Harrison
Ben is cooler than Harrison
Hunter is cooler than Ben
```
